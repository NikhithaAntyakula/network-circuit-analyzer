# Requirements
## Introduction
* Electronic circuit analyzer: The following application will be able to help any electronics engineer to analyse and find the various variables and problems when it comes to circuits. It will be able to do the following : 1. Calculate the resistance of individual components and the resistance of the circuit: a) Series b) parallel 2. Calculate the overall current in the circuit and the voltage through the components mentioned 3. Calculate the impedance based on the type of circuit 4. Calculate the power consumed by the whole circuit.
# Research
* Being an electronics engineer myself, as a student while making projects, it used to be a very tedious task for me especially during handling hardware circuits to balance the resistance and voltage accross the circuit and keep the resistance and current on the overall circuit in check. The main problems occured when the resistances were too many and the calculations differed as per the values in series and paralell. For any electronics engineer, the overalll resistance in the circuit, impedance in RLC and power calculations for the circuit to determine how long will it work for in real time were the major tasks. So, in order to shorten the calculation time and make the process automated and without human-made errors, the following system has been designed. An electronic circuit analyzer is helpful for all who are doing anything with hardware electronic or electrical circuits. It helps in determining the resistor values based on the color codes, helps determining system current based on its series or paralell architecture and also helps in calculating the overall power of the circuit and how long will the circuit work on a given impedance.
* There exist various applications on the playstore that help you calculate the resistor values based on the color codes, some that help you calculate the current in the circuit and analyze the circuit based on the voltage and current parameters. But this system has integrated all the funstions into one single program and brings you all the basic requirements of circuit analysis into one single, unified system.
# 4W'S & 1H
## Who
1. All students in high school or college level trying to use electronic circuitory.
2. All Electronic engineers for power and complex calculations
## What
Many students face problems while connecting circuits in paralell and calculations become complex when the circuit goes over 10 components in series or paralell. Also, power calculations play a vital role in every project which will be automated by this system to give exact number of days the project will work.
## When
There is no when for this project as it can be used by generations for centuries untill we need hardware technology in this world. This project will be used for all hardware siulations and resistor coding informations.
## Where
Engineering institutions, electrical projects, schools, Project development and many more.
## How
The usage of this project is very simeple as it is an input output application. The user just needs to type in whatever he or she needs for example, if he or she needs to know the current in a particular branch in the circuit, the circuit information has to be provided and the output will be given based on all the modern calculations.
